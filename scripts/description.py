    description1 ={"Apple Scab, Venturia inaequalis" :"Apple scab is a disease of Malus trees,such as apple trees, caused by the ascomycete fungus Venturia inaequalis.The disease manifests as dull black or grey-brown lesions on the surface of tree leaves, buds or fruits. Lesions may also appear less frequently on the woody tissues of the tree. Fruits and the undersides of leaves are especially susceptible. The disease rarely kills its host, but can significantly reduce fruit yields and fruit quality.Affected fruits are less marketable due to the presence of the black fungal lesions."

        ,"Apple Black Rot,Botryosphaeria obtusa" : "Botryosphaeria obtusa is a plant pathogen that causes Frogeye leaf spot, Black rot and cankers on many plant species. On the leaf it is referred to as Frogeye leaf spot; this phase typically affects tree and shrubs. In fruit such as the apple, cranberry and quince, it is referred to as Black rot, and in twigs and trunks it causes cankers."

        ,"Apple Cedar Rust, Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae":"Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae is a plant pathogen that causes cedar-apple rust. In virtually any location where apples or crabapples (Malus) and Eastern red-cedar (Juniperus virginiana) coexist, cedar apple rust can be a destructive or disfiguring disease on both the apples and cedars. Quince and hawthorn are the most common host and many species of juniper can substitute for the Eastern red cedars."

        ,"Cherry Powdery Mildew, Podosphaera spp":"Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that affects a wide range of plants. Powdery mildew diseases are caused by many different species of fungi in the order Erysiphales, with Podosphaera xanthii (a.k.a. Sphaerotheca fuliginea) being the most commonly reported cause. Erysiphe cichoracearum was formerly reported to be the primary causal organism throughout most of the world. Powdery mildew is one of the easier plant diseases to identify, as its symptoms are quite distinctive. Infected plants display white powdery spots on the leaves and stems."

       , "Corn Gray Leaf Spot, Cercospora zeae-maydis":"Grey leaf spot (GLS) is a foliar fungal disease that affects maize, also known as corn. There are two fungal pathogens that cause GLS, which are Cercospora zeae-maydis and Cercospora zeina . Symptoms seen on corn include leaf lesions, discoloration (chlorosis), and foliar blight. The fungus survives in debris of topsoil and infects healthy crop via asexual spores called conidia. Environmental conditions that best suit infection and growth include moist, humid, and warm climates. Poor airflow, low sunlight, overcrowding, improper soil nutrient and irrigation management, and poor soil drainage can all contribute to the propagation of the disease. Management techniques include crop resistance, crop rotation, residue management, use of fungicides, and weed control."

        ,"Corn Common Rust, Puccinia sorghi":"Rusts are plant diseases caused by pathogenic fungi of the order Pucciniales (previously also known as Uredinales). An estimated 168 rust genera and approximately 7000 species, more than half of which belong to the genus Puccinia, are currently accepted. Rust fungi are highly specialized plant pathogens with several unique features. Taken as a group, rust fungi are diverse and affect many kinds of plants. However, each species has a very narrow range of hosts and cannot be transmitted to non-host plants. "

        ,"Corn Northern Leaf Blight, Exserohilum turcicum":"Northern corn leaf blight (NCLB) is a foliar disease of corn (maize) caused by Exserohilum turcicum, the anamorph of the ascomycete Setosphaeria turcica. With its characteristic cigar-shaped lesions, this disease can cause significant yield loss in susceptible corn hybrids."

        ,"Grape Black Rot, Guignardia bidwellii": "Grape black rot is a fungal disease caused by an ascomycetous fungus, Guignardia bidwellii, that attacks grape vines during hot and humid weather. “Grape black rot originated in eastern North America, but now occurs in portions of Europe, South America, and Asia. It can cause complete crop loss in warm, humid climates, but is virtually unknown in regions with arid summers.”  The name comes from the black fringe that borders growing brown patches on the leaves. The disease also attacks other parts of the plant,“all green parts of the vine: the shoots, leaf and fruit stems, tendrils, and fruit. The most damaging effect is to the fruit”. "
            
        ,"Grape Black Measles (Esca), Phaeomoniella aleophilum, Phaeomoniella chlamydospora": "Esca is caused by a complex of fungi that includes several species of Phaeoacremonium, primarily by P. aleophilum (currently known by the name of its sexual stage, Togninia minima), and by Phaeomoniella chlamydospora."

        ,"Grape Leaf Blight, Pseudocercospora vitis":"Leaf blight, also called Isariopsis leaf spot (Pseudocercospora vitis) on Grape (Vitus sp.). Eriophyes vitis is a mite species in the genus Eriophyes infecting grape leaves(Vitis vinifera). This species is associated with the mite Tydeus eriophyes"

        ,"Orange Huanglongbing (Citrus Greening),Candidatus Liberibacter spp": "Citrus greening disease (Chinese pinyin: huánglóngbìng; literally: yellow dragon disease; or HLB), is a disease of citrus caused by a vector-transmitted pathogen. The causative agents are motile bacteria, Candidatus Liberibacter spp. The disease is vectored and transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri, and the African citrus psyllid, Trioza erytreae, also known as the two-spotted citrus psyllid. It has also been shown to be graft-transmissible."

        ,"Peach Bacterial Spot, Xanthomonas campestris":"Bacterial spot of peaches. Bacterial spot of peaches is caused by the bacteria Xanthomonas campestris pv. Pruni. Spots may form on the leaves and they can be mistaken for peach scab, which is caused by a fungus."

        ,"Bell Pepper Bacterial Spot, Xanthomonas campestris":"Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatora is a bacterium that causes bacterial leaf spot (BLS) on peppers and tomatoes. It is a gram-negative and rod-shaped.[1] It causes symptoms throughout the above-ground portion of the plant including leaf spots, fruit spots and stem cankers.[1][2][3][4] Since this bacterium cannot live in soil for more than a few weeks and survives as inoculum on plant debris, removal of dead plant material and chemical applications to living plants are considered effective control mechanisms."

        ,"Potato Early Blight, Alternaria solani":"Alternaria solani is a fungal pathogen, that produces a disease in tomato and potato plants called early blight. The pathogen produces distinctive bullseye patterned leaf spots and can also cause stem lesions and fruit rot on tomato and tuber blight on potato. Despite the name early, foliar symptoms usually occur on older leaves. If uncontrolled, early blight can cause significant yield reductions. Primary methods of controlling this disease include preventing long periods of wetness on leaf surfaces and applying fungicides."

        ,"Potato Late Blight, Phytophthora infestans":"Phytophthora infestans is an oomycete or water mold, a microorganism which causes the serious potato and tomato disease known as late blight or potato blight. (Early blight, caused by Alternaria solani, is also often called potato blight.) Late blight was a major culprit in the 1840s European, the 1845 Irish, and the 1846 Highland potato famines. The organism can also infect some other members of the Solanaceae. The pathogen is favored by moist, cool environments: sporulation is optimal at 12–18 C in water-saturated or nearly saturated environments, and zoospore production is favored at temperatures below 15 C. Lesion growth rates are typically optimal at a slightly warmer temperature range of 20 to 24 C"

        ,"Squash Powdery Mildew, Erysiphe cichoracearum, Sphaerotheca fuliginea":"Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that affects a wide range of plants.

        ,"Strawberry Leaf Scorch, Diplocarpon earlianum":"Diplocarpon earlianum is a fungal pathogen, that produces a disease in strawberry plants called strawberry leaf scorch. Diplocarpon earliana is of the phylum Ascmycota of fungi. The disease overwinters in plant debris and infects strawberry plants during the spring season when it is wet. The five main methods to reduce strawberry leaf scorch include: irrigation techniques, crop rotation, planting resistant, and disease free seeds, fungicide use and sanitation measures. Control of strawberry leaf scorch is important because it is responsible for the majority of disease in strawberries. Diplocarpon earliana affects the fruit quality and yield of the strawberry crop, which leads to a decrease in value assigned by the consumer."

        ,"Tomato Bacterial Spot, Xanthomonas campestris pv vesicatoria":"Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatora is a bacterium that causes bacterial leaf spot (BLS) on peppers and tomatoes. It is a gram-negative and rod-shaped.[1] It causes symptoms throughout the above-ground portion of the plant including leaf spots, fruit spots and stem cankers.[1][2][3][4] Since this bacterium cannot live in soil for more than a few weeks and survives as inoculum on plant debris, removal of dead plant material and chemical applications to living plants are considered effective control mechanisms."

        ,"Tomato Leaf Mold, Fulvia fulva": "Cladosporium fulvum is an Ascomycete called Passalora fulva, a non-obligate pathogen that causes the disease on tomato known as the Tomato leaf mold. P. fulva only attacks tomato plants, especially the foliage, and it is a common disease in the greenhouses, but can also occur in the field. The pathogen is likely to grow in humid and cool conditions. In the greenhouses, this disease causes big problems during the fall, in the early winter and spring, due to the high relative humidity of air and the temperature,[3] that are propitious for the leaf mold development."
        
        ,"Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot, Septoria lycopersici": "Septoria lycopersici is a fungal pathogen that is most commonly found infecting tomatoes. It causes one of the most destructive diseases of tomatoes and attacks tomatoes during any stage of development."
        
        ,"Tomato Two Spotted Spider Mite, Tetranychus urticae":"Tetranychus urticae (common names include red spider mite and two-spotted spider mite) is a species of plant-feeding mite generally considered to be a pest. It is the most widely known member of the family Tetranychidae or spider mites. Its genome was fully sequenced in 2011, and was the first genome sequence from any chelicerate."
            
        ,"Tomato Target Spot, Corynespora cassiicola": "Corynespora cassiicola is a species of fungus well known as a plant pathogen. It is a sac fungus in the family Corynesporascaceae. It is the type species of the genus Corynespora."

       , "Tomato Mosaic Virus":"Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) is a plant pathogenic virus. It is found worldwide and affects tomatoes and many other plants. The foliage of affected tomato plants shows mottling, with alternating yellowish and darker green areas, the latter often appearing thicker and raised giving a blister-like appearance. The leaves tend to be fern-like in appearance with pointed tips and younger leaves may be twisted. The fruit may be distorted, yellow blotches and necrotic spots may occur on both ripe and green fruit and there may be internal browning of the fruit wall. In young plants, the infection reduces the set of fruit and may cause distortions and blemishes."
        
        ,"Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus": "Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is a DNA virus from the genus Begomovirus and the family Geminiviridae. TYLCV causes the most destructive disease of tomato, and it can be found in tropical and subtropical regions causing severe economic losses. This virus is transmitted by an insect vector from the family Aleyrodidae and order Hemiptera, the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, commonly known as the silverleaf whitefly or the sweet potato whitefly. The primary host for TYLCV is the tomato plant, and other plant hosts where TYLCV infection has been found include eggplants, potatoes, tobacco, beans, and peppers."}
